3562. Maximum Profit from Trading Stocks with Discounts
You are given an integer n, representing the number of employees in a company. Each employee is assigned a unique ID from 1 to n, and employee 1 is the CEO. You are given two 1-based integer arrays, present and future, each of length n, where:

present[i] represents the current price at which the ith employee can buy a stock today.
future[i] represents the expected price at which the ith employee can sell the stock tomorrow.
The company's hierarchy is represented by a 2D integer array hierarchy, where hierarchy[i] = [ui, vi] means that employee ui is the direct boss of employee vi.

Additionally, you have an integer budget representing the total funds available for investment.

However, the company has a discount policy: if an employee's direct boss purchases their own stock, then the employee can buy their stock at half the original price (floor(present[v] / 2)).

Return the maximum profit that can be achieved without exceeding the given budget.

Note:
You may buy each stock at most once.
You cannot use any profit earned from future stock prices to fund additional investments and must buy only from budget.
